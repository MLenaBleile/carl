# Candidate Voice Style Guide

## Overview
Elena writes with precision and clarity, favoring direct statements over hedged language. Her academic background shows in structured argumentation, but she avoids unnecessary formality. She is comfortable with technical jargon and assumes the reader has domain knowledge.

## Sentence Structure
- Average sentence length: medium
- Subordinate clauses: sometimes
- Variety pattern: Alternates between short declarative sentences and longer compound sentences. Rarely uses more than one subordinate clause per sentence.
- Example characteristic sentence: "The adaptive enrichment design maintained strong Type I error control while preserving 85% of the original study's power — a tradeoff we found acceptable given the 22% reduction in sample size."

## Vocabulary
- Register: professional
- Contractions: sometimes
- First person: sparingly
- Jargon level: uses without explanation
- Words the candidate ACTUALLY uses: ["tradeoff", "framework", "approach", "method", "specifically", "notably", "given that", "in practice"]
- Words the candidate NEVER uses: ["leverage", "utilize", "synergy", "passionate", "delve", "navigate", "spearhead"]

## Tone
- Directness: very direct
- Humor: dry
- Confidence: matter-of-fact
- Uncertainty handling: acknowledges directly

## Characteristic Patterns
- Starts paragraphs with context before claims
- Uses em-dashes frequently for parenthetical remarks
- Favors active voice almost exclusively
- Quantifies outcomes wherever possible
- Prefers concrete examples over abstract statements

## Anti-Patterns (Things This Candidate Would Never Write)
- "I am passionate about statistics" (too generic, too effusive)
- "Leveraged cutting-edge methodologies" (buzzword soup)
- "I would be thrilled to bring my expertise" (performative enthusiasm)
- Three consecutive sentences starting with "I"
- Bullet points starting with the same verb pattern repeatedly

## Few-Shot Examples

### Example 1: Professional/Cover Letter Register
Source: Cover letter for Dana-Farber position (2018)
> My thesis work on adaptive enrichment designs addressed a practical problem I encountered during my MS research: most subgroup analysis methods either sacrifice too much power or lose Type I error control when the number of candidate biomarkers grows. The framework I developed maintains familywise error control while adapting enrollment to the most promising subgroups mid-trial.
>
> At Michigan, I worked with clinical teams who needed answers faster than traditional designs could provide. That experience shaped my approach — I build methods that are theoretically sound but practically deployable within the constraints of real trial timelines.

### Example 2: Technical/Academic Register
Source: Discussion section of Biometrics paper (2019)
> The proposed design achieves two goals that are typically in tension: strict familywise Type I error control and meaningful power gains from adaptive enrichment. Our simulation results show that the method maintains the nominal 2.5% one-sided error rate across all configurations tested, including adversarial scenarios where the treatment effect is concentrated in a subgroup that overlaps only partially with the biomarker-defined enrichment population.
>
> A practical limitation is the requirement for pre-specified biomarker thresholds at the design stage. In practice, this can be mitigated through a calibration phase using external data or registry studies.

### Example 3: Informal Professional Register
Source: Email to collaborator (2022)
> Quick update on the BEACON-3 analysis — the interim looks strong. The enrichment rule kicked in at IA2 as expected, and we're now enrolling primarily in the biomarker-positive subgroup. Sample size savings are tracking at about 20%, which is right in line with the simulations.
>
> One thing to flag: the safety monitoring committee had questions about the stopping boundaries. I put together a one-pager explaining the group sequential approach. Happy to walk through it if the committee wants a brief presentation.
